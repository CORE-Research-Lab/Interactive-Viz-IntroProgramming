## Overview


## Progress Log

### Week 1 (Oct 22 - 27): 
- created code skeletons, setup for files/folders
- started working on the hint button ui
- creating plan for flask + req setup with hardcoded line for now

### Week 2 (Oct 28 - Nov 3):
- created flask pipeline, still need to write some of the functions required
- wrote the build_prompt function
- wrote the parse_hints function
x need to connect actual LLM model to start testing how the output is being produced

### Week 3 (Nov 4 - Nov 10):
- Started creating the frontend script - button functionality and updating
- setup GCP account + Gemini API Key
- tested the backend-- working 
- fixed the helper functions files in utils/
- worked more on the frontend logic that connects to the backend (hint-system.js)

### Week 4 (Nov 11 - Nov 15):
 - edited the llm prompt to fix output of the set of hints
 - fixed the hint button displaying remaining hints
 - hint count resetting b/w code steps is working too
 x have to fix storage of previous hints
